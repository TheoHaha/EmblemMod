Are you tired of killing the Wall of Flesh over and over again, only to never drop your desired class emblem? 
Do you have duplicates of duplicates of all the other emblems, but not the one you want? 
Have you ever wanted a thrower emblem added to the game?

If you answered yes to any of the questions above, this mod is for you!

So what this mod does is add a couple of recipes that allow the player to craft one class emblem (warrior, ranger, sorcerer, summoner or thrower) by combining the other four in a Tinkerer's workshop, kinda like you can do with the lunar pillar fragments.

I made this mod for the sake of practice. Haven't tried it in multiplayer, but it *shouldn't* create any problems.

Credit goes to discord user "maker of scratchock live#5836" for the Thrower Emblem idea and sprite!

Changelog:
ver 0.1: Release.
ver 0.2: Changed the mod's display name from "I Want My Class Emblem" to "Craftable WoF Class Emblems" so it makes more sense. Added a new class emblem for the throwing class.
ver 0.2.1: Added a little icon.
