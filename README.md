# Craftable WoF Class Emblems (Version 0.2.1)
A mod that allows you to combine class emblems to craft any one of them you want. Also adds a throwing class emblem.

The source code of this mod contains a lot of comments, most of which are directed to me, the author.
I love taking notes and leaving notes to myself because it helps me keep track of things.
